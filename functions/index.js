// This file is currently empty as we're not using any Cloud Functions yet.
// When we need to add functions, we'll uncomment and use the appropriate imports.

// Example function (uncomment when needed)
// exports.helloWorld = (request, response) => {
//   response.send("Hello from Firebase!");
// };
