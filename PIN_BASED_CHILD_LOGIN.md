# PIN-Based Child Login System

This document explains the new PIN-based child login system implemented in The Tidy Toad app to fix the issue with the "Mark as Complete" button not working when signed in as a Kid.

## Overview

The original system used Firebase Authentication for both parents and children, which caused issues with permissions when children tried to mark tasks as complete. The new system:

1. Keeps Firebase Authentication for parents
2. Uses a PIN-based system for children with profiles stored in Firestore
3. Manages child sessions using localStorage instead of Firebase Auth
4. Properly handles task completion for children

## Implementation Details

### New Collections

- `children`: Stores child profiles with PINs
- `rewardBanks`: Stores reward data for children

### Updated Files

- `authService.js`: Added functions for registering children and verifying PINs
- `sessionService.js`: Added functions for managing child sessions
- `taskService.js`: Updated to handle tasks assigned to child profiles
- `AuthContext.js`: Updated to support both parent authentication and child sessions
- `ChildLogin.js`: Completely redesigned to use the PIN-based system
- `ChildDashboard.js`: Updated to work with child profiles
- `firestore.rules`: Updated to allow access to the new collections

## Testing the System

### Creating a Child Profile

Use the `create-test-child.js` script to create a test child profile:

```bash
node create-test-child.js <parent-email> <child-first-name> <child-last-name> <pin>
```

Example:
```bash
node create-test-child.js coreyprockwell@gmail.com jimmy Potter 1234
```

### Creating a Test Task

Use the `create-test-task.js` script to create a test task for a child:

```bash
node create-test-task.js <parent-email> <child-first-name> <task-title> <task-description> <reward-type> <reward-value>
```

Example:
```bash
node create-test-task.js parent@example.com Timmy "Clean room" "Make your bed and pick up toys" money 5.00
```

### Testing the Login and Task Completion

1. Open the app in a browser
2. Click on "Kid Login"
3. Enter the parent's email
4. Select the child's name
5. Enter the PIN
6. On the child dashboard, you should see the task
7. Click "Mark as Complete" to complete the task
8. The task should be marked as completed and a notification sent to the parent

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with the "Mark as Complete" button:

1. Check the browser console for errors
2. Verify that the child profile exists in the `children` collection
3. Verify that the task is assigned to the correct child ID
4. Make sure the Firestore rules are properly deployed

## Firestore Rules

The updated Firestore rules allow:

- Reading child profiles for anyone (needed for PIN verification)
- Writing to child profiles only for parents in the same family
- Reading and writing tasks for children in the same family

## Future Improvements

1. Add a UI for parents to manage child profiles
2. Implement password reset for child PINs
3. Add more robust session management with expiration
4. Improve error handling and user feedback
